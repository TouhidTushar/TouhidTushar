### 🌟 Featured Projects:
Here are a few notable projects that showcase my skills and expertise:

**🔹 [NECX](https://touhidtushar.com/project/5v4ksimG846dnpAQhSPZ):** The NECX (Non Emergency Communication Exchange) mobile app was my first Flutter project. This app is a proprietary software of an US based tech startup. Through this app, NECX aims to establish transparency and create a bridge between law enforcement agencies and victims of crime. The app enables victims to maintain real-time communication with their assigned law enforcement officer, offering victims the opportunity to claim specific victim services offered by their department while receiving case status updates. The app is currently available on both Google Play Store and App Store. NECX started their initial limited rollout for the town of Marion in Virginia, US.

**🔹 [BTMA](https://touhidtushar.com/project/AaBOIgON2o0HtDFCsBYq):** BTMA was the first project assigned to me at Manush Tech. Our team worked relentlessly to deliver this software. This is currently in production and being used actively. The software aids day to day operations for Bangladesh Textile Mills Association. Having two seperate pannels for the association members and the admins, the overall system includes wide range of modern dashboard features. Subscription model for membership, daily report generation, certification and employee data management are the few highlights from them.

**🔹 [R-SQUARED](https://touhidtushar.com/project/LMKV2xc9weMlXbWUQUmO):** R-SQUARED was a freelance project. I along with Jamilur Rahman finished this one back in July 2022. It was officially launched in August 2022. The site acts as a portfolio for a team of data driven business decision makers, data scientists and engineers working as strategists. It was my first time working with blogs and text editors for a CMS. Overall, it was a fun experience.

**🔹 [ISBM](https://touhidtushar.com/project/75WjAWXR8HU1tyzYCx1C):** The International Society of Bangladesh-Affiliated Microbiologists (ISBM), a Canada-based organization, initiated the development of a community platform. Jamilur Rahman and I have been engaged as freelance contractors to work on this project since July 2022. Currently in progress, the platform aims to serve as a dedicated online hub for microbiologists associated with Bangladesh, residing worldwide. Membership is the primary mode of access, with various subscription plans available. The platform's core features encompass fostering connections and networking among members, facilitating the sharing of posts, blogs, and publications, enabling seamless communication within the community, providing job opportunities, and managing events. As the production release approaches, we eagerly anticipate the outcome of this endeavor.

**🔹 [PULSE](https://touhidtushar.com/project/9V4LoQFSVWY4nnusyYbN):** Pulse is the latest project I am working on at Manush Tech. I will not share much about this project before the beta release. Just know that this will be an analytics platform. Our team at Manush Tech is working together to build something amazing in the near future. Stay tuned for updates on pulse.
